This is an implementation of the population choropleth map of Nepal in d3.js. I have done very basic stuff right now but it should be a good starting point.

![d3.js Population Choropleth of Nepal](https://github.com/batuwa/nepal_d3_map/blob/master/images/screenshot.png)

It includes basic tooltips as an improvement from the initial version.

Please feel free to contribute and extend it as you please.

Usage:

- clone the repo
- open up a terminal / command line and cd in the folder
- run a basic web server, e.g. pythom -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000
- go to the localhost and port of the server, e.g localhost:8000 in your browser.
